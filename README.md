## 🚀 About Me
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a **robot head** project powered by **Arduino** that reacts to user input by turning to face the speaker and expressing body language in response to what’s said.
- 🌱 I’m learning **C++**, **large language models**, building **custom AI chabots**, and diving deep into **robotics**.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **robotics**, **game development**, and **AI-related** projects.
- 💬 Ask me about **game development**, **robotics**, or **AI**.
- 📫 How to reach me via email: lmacurdy315@gmail.com.

## 🧩 Projects
Here are some of my recent or favorite projects:

### 1. Robot Head
- **Technologies: Arduino, C++, Servo Motors, Sensors**
- **Description:** Created a robot head that turns to face the user and expresses different body language based on voice input. Utilizes **Arduino** for hardware control and programming.

### 2. AI Chatbot
- **Technologies: Python, TensorFlow, NLP**
- **Description:** Built a **custom AI chatbot** that learns from user interactions and improves over time. Integrated natural language processing (NLP) to simulate meaningful conversations.

### 3. Sketchy Jumps (Game Development)
- **Technologies: Unity, GDScript**
- **Description:** Developed a 2D platformer game prototype with basic mechanics including character movement, physics, and collision detection using **Godot** and **GDScript**.
